# Northwind Data Visualizations
## Description

This project delves into the Northwind database, housing a variety of data for Northwind Traders, a fictional company that specializes in the export and import of specialty foods. My objective is to craft visualizations that narrate the company's story and facilitate data-driven business decisions. To achieve this, I leverage two key tools:
1. PostgreSQL was utilized to pull data from the Northwind database that I used to create my visualizations and perform other tasks, such as managing inventory and analyzing customer purchasing behavior.
2. Tableau was used to develop two comprehensive dashboards, enabling in-depth analysis of both sales data and employee performance metrics.

Here you will find the file containing the queries that were used, the tables that I created to make my visualizations and a link to my dashboards on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giovanni.pecorino/viz/NorthwindDashboards/SalesBreakdown?publish=yes).

## About the Dataset

This database contains information regarding orders, customers, employees, suppliers and products of Northwind Traders, distributed across multiple tables. To streamline the analysis process, I solely selected information critical for addressing pertinent business inquiries. Utilizing these refined queries, I generated three tables within this repository, serving as the foundation for crafting my visualizations.

The first table all_order_data.csv contains relevant information for all orders in the database. It has 17 features:
1. Orderid - Order number 
2. Employee - Name of employee that made the sale
3. Order_Date - Date the order was placed
4. Required_Date - Date the customer requires the order by
5. Shipped_Date - Date the order was shipped
6. Shipper - Company that is handling the shipping
7. Freight - Price it costs to ship order
8.Customer - Customer that made the order
9. City - City customer is located in
10. Country - Country customer is located in
11. Product - Product name
12. Category - Category that product belongs to
13. Current_Price - The current price for 1 unit of the product
14. Ordered_Price - The price of the product at the time of order
15. Quantity - Number of units of product ordered 
16. Discount - Amount discounted from the order
17. Total_Sale_Price - Total price of all units ordered

The following table, profit_data.csv, provides insights into the products within each order and the profits generated by Northwind Traders from each transaction. This portion contains data that I generated for this analysis. The original Northwind database did not contain information regarding the amount of profit that was garnered on each order, so to perform this degree of analysis I utilized 2 key assumptions. First, I assumed that prices listed in this dataset referred to the price that Northwind Traders sells the products to consumers for. Second, I assumed that they yielded a profit ranging from 10% to 40% on each product. These margins were determined using available information about average profit margins for real import/export companies. I randomly assigned values in this range to each product to create a cost that Northwind Traders pays to the suppliers for each unit of product. This table contains 16 features:
1. Orderid - Order number
2. Product - Product name
3. Category - Category that product belongs to
4. Order_Date - Date the order was placed
5. Employee - Name of employee that made the sale
6. Customer - Customer that made the order
7. Customer_Price - The price of the product at the time of order
8. Quantity - Number of units of product ordered 
9. Discount - Amount discounted from the order
10. Purchased_Price -  Price of 1 unit of product after applying the discount
11. Supplier_Price - The price Northwind Traders pays to the product supplier
12. Profit_per_Unit - Amount profited off of 1 unit of product
13. Profit_per_Unit_Percent - Percent profited off of 1 unit of product
14. Total_Supplier_Cost - Total cost Northwind pays to supplier for all units of product ordered
15. Total_Sale_Price - Total price customer pays for all units ordered
16. Total_Profit - Total amount profited off of all units ordered

The last table included is the employee_best_customer.csv which shows the customers that employees sold the most to each year. This table contains 4 features:
1. Employee - Name of employee that made the sale
2. Year - Year
3. Customer- Name of the customer
4. Total_Sales - Total amount sold to customer



## Conclusions
